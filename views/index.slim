  .hero Stockholm Ruby arranges meetups where we learn from each other, network, socialize and sometimes code.

  .details
    p Everyone's welcome. You don't have to be an expert, a Ruby professional or even a programmer at all. If you're curious and in the neighborhood, drop by!

    p Stockholm Ruby belongs to you. There's no leadership and you don't need anyone's permission to organize any kind of event you like, of any size.
